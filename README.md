## CA Dept. of Justice OpenJustice Project
### Modeling & Hypothesis Testing

Below, members of the [Data Science Working Group](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg) have been charged with answering, via inferential statistics, some of the California Department of Justice's inquiries around criminal justice. These more pointed inquiries were inspired by the OpenJustice project's exploratory analyses at [OpenJustice.org](http://wwww.openjustice.org).  

Responsible DSWG Members:
+ Catherine Zhang
+ Sushma Y.
+ Peter James
+ Holly Davis
+ Jude Calvillo

#### Status, as of June 23, 2016:

+ Prompts were verified by the CA DOJ's OpenJustice team, and we're now in regular contact.
+ Almost done with hypothesis testing for Prompt #1 (Jude C.).
+ Predictive modeling for Prompt #3 already underway (Catherine Z.).
+ Continuing to gather additional data/features for predictive modeling prompts.

#### The Prompts

1. Which counties/agencies arrest African American juveniles at a statistically significantly higher rate than that of other counties/agencies?
    - Extending analysis to each ethnic group represented
    - Drilling down to felonies vs. misdemeanors
    
2. Is the arrest rate of any particular ethnic juvenile group statistically significantly different from that of the remainder, statewide? Are particular groups more likely to be convicted for the same crime?

3. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for felonies?

4. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for battery, specifically?

5. For resource allocation prompt: ~. predictors to crime rate (i.e. not necessarily optimization; just a first, exploratory step)
